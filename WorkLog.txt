.LOG

10:09 AM 3/8/2021
Initial creation of Log file.

10:11 AM 3/8/2021
Powershell function "log" added to open this log file.

12:46 PM 3/8/2021
Currently working on the alert monitor that searches for exceptions recorded in Cosmos DB. 
Starting with just the azure functions, certain thresholds will need to be set that when passed alerts will be sent via email. 
To start the threshold for each function will be set to 5 exceptions per day. If passed an email will be sent to the ECS Development mailbox. 

3:42 PM 3/8/2021
The main method of alert monitor will record how many exceptions were found in the current day. 
A list of azure function names will need to be created to use in filtering the counts of exceptions by function. 
It will most likely be easier working with an object instead of a dynamic that is curretly being returned. 
What information am I going to want to see when an alert is generated?
	Function name, method, message, exception, stack trace.
What happens if multiple different exceptions are happeing from different methods?
	For now the count will be function specific and if the count is over 5 the alert will trigger.
What happens if the email fails to send?
	Alert data will be recorded separately to cosmos as a fatal event. 
	Could be possible to have a separate function monitoring cosmos directly for fatal events

6:31 AM 3/9/2021
Start by creating a list of log objects from the returned dynamic object that contains the logs.

7:31 AM 3/9/2021
Create the alert objects from the log objects, then check if the threshold is met.
Build email and send to ECS mailbox if met. 

11:23 AM 3/9/2021
Email logic used from SecDevLib2 and still need to create the email template. 
Dynamic log objects are converted to LogObjects and put in a list.
LogObjects are then parsed to AlertObjects and put in a list.
Check threshold, if passed continue
Email template is defined from AlertObjectList.
Alert Email is defined from email template and sent.

9:08 AM 3/10/2021
There were some difficulties in running the local Azure emulator which were resolved by deleting the local config db.
To prevent the need for the schedule delay, the code was copied to a console app to test the code faster.  
All logic is there and a basic template generator was created that will need to be updated for more viewable data. 

1:13 PM 3/10/2021
Function app is now sending emails to the ECS Development mailbox as designed. All methods have been updated with logging and the function app is ready to deploy.

1:26 PM 3/10/2021
Adding the list of RHL projects to arc will require a check in the candidate lookup method to use the project name to query against the dynamic alert lists.

2:10 PM 3/10/2021
The project name is now being queried agaisnt the dynamic alert list. The new list was added as a dynamic alert and confirmed to be showing in the alerts box when a candidate is looked up. A new ServiceNowIncident property will need to be added, it will be a bool IsRhlProjectCandidate that will be checked when creating a SNow incident. If true a string will be added to the long description notifying that the customer is a rhl project candidate. 

4:53 PM 3/10/2021
Candidates that are looked up will have their project name checked against the alert list, then if matched will alert that the candidate is a RHL Project candidate. When the incident is sent to servicenow and the RHL project alert is present, the long description text will be updated on the first line with "Candidate Is On RHL Project". 

9:50 AM 3/11/2021
AlertMonitorAzFunc funciton app was created in azure then the local solution was deployed. Updated the README.me and all changes were pushed to Gitlab. All app settings were added to the new azure function and saved. 

9:51 AM 3/11/2021
An old version of arc was foud to be running on kweark01's computer and an email was sent to him letting him know he needs to reinstall arc. Waiting on his response now before closing out the planner task.

11:26 AM 3/11/2021
The RHL Project candidate alert in ARC will show "Candidate On RHL Project"
The following line will be added to the top of the long description and in work notes: Candidate Is On RHL Project

12:18 PM 3/11/2021
Ramon wants to see the emails coming with the RHL project list being automatically parsed and read into the dynamic alert list storage so that they do not have to be manually updated each time. 
There will need to be a listener set up on the ECS Mailbox that can read the email and parse the attachment. Once parsed the data will need to be added to the block containing the dynamic alert list blobs. 

12:40 PM 3/11/2021
Work log notes were copied to the planner card for the AlertmonitorAzFunc

12:43 PM 3/11/2021
Work log notes were copied to the planner card for the RHL Project Candidate Alert
Followed up with Joe Cid to let him know that the groups that we added to the svc account did not authorize the enabling of disabled computers. 
Russell got back letting me know that he will be setting up a time to get together to review and approve the repair sccm powershell script. I followed up with Rudy to see if he had documentation on where get got the flags to reinstall sccm, but he said he got them from Nick A. 

12:50 PM 3/11/2021
The permission issues were resolved in service now and the required table can now be accessed, now the next problem is to figure out the work flow and have merge request approvals worked out so that the scripts that I add can be viewable from the service now request. 

9:26 AM 3/12/2021
svcARC has access to the ECS Development mailbox. 
svcARC will need to read the mailbox and search for emails that have a specific subject. When the email is found the attachment will have to be read and parsed into an alert object to be uploaded to blob in the dynamic alerts container. Evan will have to be notified to keep the format of the email the same and the structure of the excel file the same. 

9:39 AM 3/12/2021
A new azure function will have to be created to run on a schedule. The function will need to create the connection to the ECS Development mailbox using the svcARC account, read items in the mailbox, search each item, if rhl project list email found return, injest the attachment, parse into dynamic alert object, create blob file string, find and remove old rhl project blob and create new from new data. 

11:43 AM 3/12/2021
Azure functions can only run .net core, and the websevices exchange library only works with .net framework. 
In order for this function app to work it will need to be authenticated with the Identity platform. 

4:05 PM 3/12/2021
Using the Ews library from SecDevV2 library, the shared mailbox was accessed and all emails were read using the svcARC account. 
With the list of emails returned, the sender will be used to find the specific email, then the excel attachment will have to be parsed, the used to create a dynamic alert object, then that object will be uploaded to blob. The older blob will then have to be removed. 

2:22 PM 3/15/2021
The mailbox monitor automation logic has been written.
The mailbox is connected to, inbox emails are checked for a specific sender.
When found the email is checked for an attachment with a specific name. When found the file is assumed to be an excel file and read with ExcelDataReader. The values are parsed to a list and used to create a string that is sent to blob. The file being sent to blob is used as the Dynamic alert that is checked by arc. The old dynamic alert is deleted and the email is moved to an inbox subfolder called AutomatedEmails. 
Logging will have to be added to all methods, local info needs to be defined, logic needs to be moved to an azure function, finally the delete logic will need to be updated to only delete the old dynamic alert. Most likely it will need to be deleted first unless the name includes the date. 

8:53 AM 3/17/2021
Yesterday logging was added to all methods, local info defined, logic moved to azure function, and core functionality updated to the correct workflow. 
Today the logs showed that the main method did not provide the correct result in the message when an attachment was not found. The flow was updated and all results in the logs are now showing correctly. The timer was updated to run every hour. All updates were deployed to azure and pushed to gitlab. 

11:02 AM 3/17/2021
Updated the RHLProjectSender config field with the correct sender email address. 
Email sent to evan to let him know to send all future emails with the list to the ECS development mailbox. 

11:24 AM 3/17/2021
Issue was determined that if multiple emails from the sender are present the logic will not function properly. This was updated to loop through all emails found from the sender to make sure the function app doesn't finish after attempting to parse the first email. 

11:25 AM 3/17/2021
Evan sent the new list of projects to the mailbox and now I am waiting on the scheduled function to run to make sure everything functions as designed.

field techs had their manager updated to Teddy, and were locked out of ARC. The profile access class was updated with the new value and published to all users.
Mailbox monitor was checking the excel file for all sheets, and it needed to use only the last sheet. The function app was updated to use Datasets when reading excel files, then logic was added to find the last sheet and loop through to find the project names. 
Function app was tested successfully, then deployed to azure. 

9:32 AM 3/22/2021

Two users so far have had issues accessing arc since the update to SnowProfile access checks. 
jarnow01 & adrtan01
Issue seems to be due to a response from the azure function that arc is failing to parse.
"Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: S. Path '', line 0, position 0."
DefineSnowProfile was updated to log the response string to determine what is being returned  that is causing the fail to parse. 
Updated the defineSnowProfile method to check for the missing param response before deserialzing the snowprofile object.
Added null check to SetSnowProfle to prevent null reference exception, added warning when found null
Changed default access value to false in Profile
Added more response checks and refactored DeserializeSnowProfile to separate method with verbose logging
Added role definition to legacy profile definition
deployed to all users

Jfog idea - "My first thought is that I would like him to write a program (Python of course!) that would pull the latest information from a CloudWatch Logs group and extract information from a JSON file.  The information should then be written to an Excel file that has the date as row and the cloudwatch group as column.  the value should be in the intersection."

Lambda function has permissions to read log groups, log streams, log events, and read/write objects in the specific created s3 bucket.
The lambda runs python 3.8 and executes a script that reads specific log groups in cloudwatch and formats the found data into a csv that is then uploaded to S3. Each execution appends a new line on the csv file and is re-uploaded to S3 with the same name.
